# Project Name: Express Currency Converter

## Description:

  This application of mine will allow users to be able to convert 50 major currencies from at least 70 countries across the   globe to their preferred choices of output. It will take a base currency (USD) and convert immediately upon the user's input and selection of the currency that he/she wants converted. The users will also be able to view live exchange rates of the 7 currencies (USD, SGD, EUR, GBP, INR & AUD & PHP) even before they do any conversion. They will be able to view first of one unit of the selected currency of the afore-mentioned currencies.  

  Users will also be able to toggle between any two currencies when they are using the application and this will allow them to know in an instance how much they are looking to get back when they return from their trips. Exchange rates data are updated at least once every 24 hours with data collected from a number of central banks across the world. Last but not least, this converter also uses the standard abbreviations for all the currencies making it super user-friendly for users!

## UX:

  To explain how the currency converter works, when a user visits the site, he or she will need to first select the currency to be converted (A). Thereafter, the user will will have to select the currency that he or she wants to be converted into(B). Finally the user will have to input the amount (a number up to 2 decimal places) before clicking convert to get the converted amount.

## Features:

  Feature 1: This will be the main feature of the currency converter where the user will need to input value to be converted (C) and choose the corresponding currencies (A) & (B).

  Feature 2: The user will be able to select the different currencies from (A) & (B). The list of avaiable currencies will be shown once the user clicks on the drop down button.

  Feature 3: The user will be able to see the daily live exchange rates for the 7 selected countries.

## Technologies Used:

  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Testing:

I have done simple testing on both columns to ensure that the currencies selected in both (A) & (B) are working and the amount that I have input has been correctly reflected.

The 7 selected live currencies to show are also updated when I went in to check on a daily basis.

Testing - This is being tested with chrome , safari and internet edge. 
Mobile responsiveness is tested for screen size 1440px , 768px , 425px  

Manual Testing is done to ensure that the all functions are functional.
